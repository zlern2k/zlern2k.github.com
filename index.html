<h1>Wedding Registry for Katie Goetz and Daniel Weaver</h1>

<p>Thank you for your interest in giving us a wedding gift! This is very sweet
and we really appreciate it. The reality for us is that we are merging two
fully functional adult households, and therefore we have enough stuff - in
fact, we have to get rid of much of what we already have to fit into one
house together. So instead of household gifts for us, we would like to ask
you to support an organization that promotes social justice and economic
opportunity. Below are four organizations we have been supporting for
several years.</p>

on staff with them, and currently serves on their board of directors.</p>
